Welcome to my homepage! I received my PhD in industrial and systems engineering from University of Washington in 2019. During my PhD years, I mostly worked as a research assistant for [Boeing Advanced Research Center](https://depts.washington.edu/barc/), focusing on exploring the use of [topological data analysis](/tag/topological-data-analysis/) in [computer vision](/publication/sparse-tda) and [dynamic networks](/publication/network-tda). During that time, I have partaken in multiple Boeing projects aimed at revamping manufacturing processes with state‐of‐the‐art machine learning solutions for increased efficiency. One project where I played a major role, titled "[Deep learning for automated in-process inspection of composite layup](https://depts.washington.edu/barc/projects/data-science-manufacturing)," was recognized by winning the <span style="color:#E13D3D">best presentation award</span> in data analytics track at the *Boeing Tech Excellence Conference* in 2019. A US patent application is also being filed for this work.

In addition, I am passionate about the application of [deep learning](/tag/deep-learning/) to autonomous systems. The field of autonomous systems also reconnects the experience I have gained in resolving [trajectory optimization problems of aerial vehicles in winds / obstacle fields](/publication/uav-seeability) during my graduate studies at University of Minnesota. I am currently in a transition from academia to industry. I expect to start working from May, 2020.

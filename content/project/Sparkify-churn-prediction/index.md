Predicting customer churn is a challenging and common problem for any e-commerce business in which everything depends on the behavior of customers. Customer churn is often defined as the process in which the customers downgrade from premium to free tier or stop using the products or services of a business. Thus, the ability to predict which users are at risk of churning, while there is still time to offer them discounts or other incentives, will greatly help to prevent every custormer-facing business from suffering severe financial losses.

The data set in this project is provided by Sparkify, a fictitious digital music service created by Udacity, to resemble the data sets generated by companies such as Spotify or Pandora. Millions of users stream their favorite songs through Sparkify's platform on a daily basis, either using the free tier that places advertisements between the songs or using the premiumn subscription model which is typically ad-free by paying a monthly flat rate. Users can upgrade, downgrade or cancel their service at any time. Thus, it is crucial to ensure the users love the service. Our goal in this project is to help Spakify identify potential churn users by building and training a binary classifier so as to save the business millions in revenue.

## Data understanding

Data is generated everytime a user interacts with the service while playing songs, logging out, liking a song with a thumbs up or adding a friend etc. The full dataset consists of approximately 26 million records from 22277 users, whereas a smaller subset contains 286500 records from 225 users between October 1, 2018 and December 3, 2018. The model development proces present here is performed on the smaller subset using Python API for Spark, PySpark.

### Data description

Since there is no documentation provided alongside the datasets, we first have to conduct a comprehensive data analysis to gain the understanding of the data. A detailed description of the variables are shown below.

* **artist**: (string) artist name
* **auth**: (string) authentication level; 4 categories (Logged In, Logged Out, Cancelled, Guest)
* **firstName**: (string) user’s first name
* **gender**: (string) user’s gender; 2 categories (M and F)
* **itemInSession**: (int) log count in a given session
* **lastName**: (string) user’s last name
* **length**: (double) song’s length in seconds
* **level**: (string) subscription level; 2 categories (free and paid)
* **location**: (string) user’s location
* **method**:  (string) http request method; 2 categories (GET and PUT)
* **page**: (string) type of interaction; 22 categories (NextSong, Home, Cancellation Confirmation, etc.)
* **registration**: (int) user’s registration timestamp
* **sessionId**: (int) session to which the log belongs to
* **song**: (string) song name currently being played
* **status**: (int) http status code; 3 categories (200, 307 and 404)
* **ts**: (int) timestamp of a given log
* **userAgent**: (string) agent used by the user to access the streaming service; 57 different categories
* **userId**: (string) user identifier

### Notes and observations

After checking null values, we find
* Variables with null values can be divided into two groups, i.e.:
Group 1 (user-related): firstName, gender, lastName, location, registration and userAgent
Group 2 (song-related): artist, length and song

## Exploratory data analysis

We use the *Cancellation Confirmation* events of page column to define the customer churn. There are 52 churned users in a total of 225 users in the dataset. That's about 23.1% churn rate.

<p align="center">
    <img src="feature_correlations.png" style="width:100%;">
</p>

From the heatmap above, we find

* There is a high correlation between most of the page event activities. For example, variables avgDailySongs, avgDailyThumbsUp, avgDailyDowngrade, avgDailyAddFriend, avgDailyAddPlaylist and avgDailyHelp are almost perfectly correlated. To avoid multicolinearity in the data, we only retain avgDailyAddPlaylist here (as it has the highest correlation with Churn).

* Churn doesn not appear to have strong correlations with any features. registDuration is negatively correlated with Churn while avgDaily has the highest positive correlation with Churn. It also shows that gender, latestLevel, avgSessionDuration and avgDailyError all have very low correlation with Churn. This is consistent with our previous findings through direct visualization. However, the Pearson correlation assumes a linear relationship, and a low correlation simply means that there is no linear relationship between these features and the response variable. The data might still have a nonlinear relationship and should be included in the modeling for now.
